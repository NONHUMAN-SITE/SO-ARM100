# SOARM100

![SOARM100](https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100/blob/main/media/SOARM100.png)

SOARM100 is an open-source robotics project. The robot's design is available at [The Robot Studio](https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100). For training, we leverage algorithms implemented in [Hugging Face's LeRobot](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot).  

This repository serves as a hub for NONHUMAN projects, including variations, datasets, and experimental developments.  

## Projects  

### Agentic SOARM100  
Agentic SOARM100 aims to integrate AI agents, Text-to-Speech (TTS), and Speech-to-Text (STT) models. Once trained with multiple skills, SOARM100 can be controlled intelligently through a preferred Large Language Model (LLM). The interaction is designed to be natural, utilizing a custom interface we have designed instead of relying solely on a command-line interface (CLI), ensuring a more seamless and user-friendly experience.

### Neuro SOARM100  
Neuro SOARM100 explores EEG and EMG signal processing for neural teleoperation. The userâ€™s arm serves as the leading controller, enabling intuitive and direct manipulation of the robotic arm.  

For further details, visit our documentation at [NONHUMAN Research Wiki](https://www.nonhuman.site/research/wiki/SO-ARM100).  

## Installation  

To set up SOARM100, follow the installation guide available in [LeRobot's documentation](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot/blob/main/examples/10_use_so100.md).  

> **Tip:** It is recommended to use `poetry` for dependency management and project setup. Build the project using the `pyproject.toml` file for a streamlined installation.  

## Guides  

Detailed guides for both projects can be found in the `/guides` directory.
